# Featuresâ€‹
**1. Spawn - Controlling entities spawn conditions.**  
It will cancel the spawn event and save CPU resource consumption which caused by entities activity. You can add any entity you want in config. For example, the Guardian tower spawn mobs really fast, and a large number of jumping Guardians will cause server lag.  
Improve MythicMobs "RandomSpawn" and avoid the bug of spawn mobs without limit.

**2. Damage - Controling entities' damage or kill the dying creatures immediately to save resource.**
